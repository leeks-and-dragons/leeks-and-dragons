Great RPG Village or RPG Exploration music. But I think it could be used for all kinds of things as well! You may use this for any project that you like but, I will ask that you let me know that you are going to use it and I would love to see the finished project as well. I am open to the idea of rearranging it to fit your game just leave me an email and we will see what we can do! Cheers!! (Music was made to be loop-able)
