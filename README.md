## Elevator Pitch

```text
Tired of the stereotyped muscular hero, that seems like
the dude you will never be in real life? Tired of playing a
dude, that manages every skill perfectly and never
struggles with anything? Tired of the same basic
gameplay and linear stories, that you find in every
corner of Steam?
Then this is for you: A little, weak guy is forced to leave
his hometown to become a man. Being a little wimp, he
travels the world full of leek varieties. And yes, there will
be dragons, too.
